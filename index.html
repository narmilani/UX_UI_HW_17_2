                <p> I currently reside in Portland, Oregon, and I work at a gaming company called Skillz as a Content Creator. Before moving, I lived and grew up in Long Island, NY. 
During undergrad, I collaborated with fellow journalism students in producing and editing videos as a part of Allen Hall Media. I worked at a small tech start-up in Eugene, Oregon called Nulia, and as Video Editor until graduation. 
I enjoy making homemade kombucha in my free time, listening to mystery podcasts, and attending barre classes. I also enjoy collaborating and chatting over a good cup of coffee.
